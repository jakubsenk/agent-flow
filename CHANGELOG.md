## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-29

> **MAJOR — breaking.** The dispatch witness moves from an orchestrator-written
> `sha256` receipt to a **gate-signed HMAC keyed witness**. Four independent MAJOR
> triggers: (1) the witness output contract changes (`sha256` 5-tuple → per-field
> sub-hashed HMAC-SHA256 keyed tag recorded in a gate-owned ledger, never in
> `state.json`); (2) the first **non-additive** `schema_version` bump (`1.0` → `2.0`);
> (3) a **new blocking PreToolUse `Task` gate** (`hooks/validate-dispatch-pre.sh`)
> that can deny a dispatch before it runs (Claude Code ≥ 2.1.90); and (4) the A2
> mandatory `## Step Completion Invariants` agent-section rewording.

### Added

- **Gate-as-signer dispatch witness (PreToolUse `Task` gate).** A new
  `hooks/validate-dispatch-pre.sh` is the sole holder of the per-run key
  (`.agent-flow/{RUN-ID}/dispatch.key`, 64-hex, `0600`, atomic `O_EXCL`) and the only
  component that computes and records a signed witness. It resolves the in-flight
  dispatch from a top-level marker (`.agent-flow/pending-dispatch.json`, never
  `glob[-1]`), applies match-or-pass-through (a `Task` it did not mark passes through
  — parallel/non-agent-flow dispatch is never blocked), observes-and-signs
  `head128(tool_input.prompt)` as ground truth, compares the deterministically
  reproducible CLAIM fields, signs an HMAC-SHA256 tag into a gate-owned ledger
  (`.agent-flow/{RUN-ID}/dispatch-ledger.jsonl`), and ALLOWs — or emits a deny
  envelope + `exit 2` (the true block).
- **Per-run key lifecycle + forge-resistant bootstrap.** The gate generates the key
  once on a genuine first intercept (key absent AND zero completed stages in
  `state.json` AND empty/absent ledger); a key absent on a progressed run is
  `WITNESS_UNVERIFIABLE`/DENY, never a silent re-sign.
- **Fourth verdict `WITNESS_UNVERIFIABLE`** distinguishing "cannot check" (key lost,
  no ledger entry, stale/replayed marker) from "proven inconsistent"
  (`WITNESS_MISMATCH`).
- **New CLAIM/marker fields** in `state.json` / the marker: `claim_nonce`,
  `dispatch_seq`, `override_path`, and top-level `schema_version "2.0"`.
- **`/check-setup` probes** — Python stdlib (`import sys,hmac,hashlib,secrets`), the
  TOML overlay parser, `claude --version` ≥ 2.1.90, and a once-per-machine deny-canary
  handshake (reserved sentinel `agent-flow:__deny_canary__`).
- **`.gitattributes` LF pins** (`tests/fixtures/** text eol=lf`, `*.toml`, `*.json`) so
  hashed byte-identity holds on MSYS2 and Linux CI.

### Changed

- **`overlay_digest` redefined** as the `sha256` of the **RAW, LF-normalized `.toml`
  file bytes** at `override_path/<short>.toml` (no longer the rendered Markdown block).
  The gate reads the bytes once and signs the same held bytes; a forged
  `override_path` escaping the allowlist, an absent `.toml`, or a one-byte body edit is
  a `WITNESS_MISMATCH`/DENY.
- **`prompt_head_128` is no longer an orchestrator-committed/compared CLAIM field** —
  the gate observes the post-expansion dispatched head and signs it as ground truth
  (this removes the round-1 prompt-head false-DENY by construction).
- **PostToolUse audit (`hooks/validate-dispatch.sh`) re-verifies the gate signature**
  and is acknowledged everywhere as a second layer that cannot block (it runs after the
  tool). "Fails the dispatch" language now refers only to the PreToolUse gate.
- **Python is the single keyed authority** — the keyed HMAC compute/verify lives only
  in `hooks/lib/witness_core.py`; the bash `core/lib/stage-invariant.sh` keyed path is
  demoted to a parity-pinned self-test.
- **Honest threat model** rewritten in `state/schema.md`: keying buys detection of
  out-of-key tampering and a real pre-dispatch block, but does NOT prove the subagent
  ran and does not stop a deliberately malicious same-OS-user process. The audit log is
  labeled "best-effort append-only audit log".
- **Env vars** continue the clean-break `AGENT_FLOW_` prefix
  (`AGENT_FLOW_STRICT_DISPATCH`, `AGENT_FLOW_DISPATCH_KEY_FILE`, `AGENT_FLOW_LEDGER`,
  `AGENT_FLOW_MARKER_TTL`, `AGENT_FLOW_OVERRIDE_PATH`, `AGENT_FLOW_STATE_JSON`,
  `AGENT_FLOW_AUDIT_LOG`).
- **`## Step Completion Invariants`** wording updated in lockstep across the agent and
  `examples/custom-agents/*` definitions; `agents/acceptance-gate.md`'s self-check now
  reads the gate-owned ledger instead of recomputing via the demoted bash path.

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform LF output in the dispatch hooks** — the audit-log and ledger writers
  in `hooks/validate-dispatch.sh` and `hooks/validate-dispatch-pre.sh` now open their
  append/write targets with explicit `newline="\n"`, so audit-log and ledger lines are
  LF on every platform (Windows MSYS2 text-mode previously emitted CRLF, breaking
  per-line `^…$` assertions and byte-identical cross-platform output).
- **`__read_stage_field` truncation (A1)** — `core/lib/stage-invariant.sh` now reads
  stage fields via the same `json.load` one-liner the hook uses, so a `{placeholder}`,
  quote, comma, or non-ASCII head is read byte-exact instead of being truncated by the
  old `sed -E` extraction.

### Migration

- **Strict by default, env-only toggle.** Dispatch enforcement remains strict by
  default. To roll back: **Lever 1** — set `AGENT_FLOW_STRICT_DISPATCH: "0"` in the
  `env` block of `.claude/settings.json` (the persistent lever) and/or drop a top-level
  `.agent-flow/STRICT_DISPATCH_OFF` flag file (the reliable in-run lever, checked before
  any marker/run resolution); **Lever 2** — remove the PreToolUse `Task` matcher from
  `settings.json`. A bare `export AGENT_FLOW_STRICT_DISPATCH=0` in a project file does
  NOT reach the Claude-Code-spawned hook.
- **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.90 required** for the PreToolUse block to take effect (issue
  #26923: `Task` exit-2 was a no-op before 2.1.90). On an older client the gate degrades
  to PostToolUse-advisory; `/check-setup` and the deny-canary surface this loudly.
- **No new Automation Config section** — the strict toggle stays env-only, so the
  optional-section count remains 18 and the doc-counts stay 17 agents / 17 skills /
  17 core contracts.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Browser Verification: `Stop command` optional key** — the `browser-agent` now stops the app it started via `Start command` once reproduction/verification finishes: it runs the configured `Stop command` if set, otherwise falls back to `pkill -f` on the `Start command` pattern (POSIX-only). Set `Stop command` on non-POSIX hosts where `pkill` is unavailable, or when `Start command` is a launcher that exits before the app it spawned (so the pattern no longer matches the running process). If the app was already running when the agent checked `Base URL`, it is left running. Parsed by `core/config-reader.md` as `browser.stop_command`, prompted by `/onboard`, documented in `docs/reference/automation-config.md`, and wired into a new verify-phase cleanup step in `agents/browser-agent.md`. New optional key — no Automation Config contract break.
- **check-setup: Agent Overrides TOML-overlay validation (Block 7)** — `/check-setup` now detects the silent-drop failure mode where `customization/*.toml` overlays are present but no TOML parser is importable (`python3` missing, or neither `tomllib` (Python 3.11+) nor the `tomli` backport available) — the override injector absorbs the parse error and dispatches agents with the bare prompt, so configured per-agent customizations never apply and nothing surfaces it. When a parser IS available, each overlay is validated end-to-end (syntax + unknown-key) by sourcing `setup-agents/lib/toml-merge.sh` in guarded form. A present-but-unparseable overlay is a `[FAIL]` (counts toward the verdict); a clean project with no overlays is `[SKIP]`. `Browser Verification` and `Agent Overrides` were also added to the Block 1 optional-section format checks. Documented in `docs/guides/toml-overlay-syntax.md`, `installation.md`, and `troubleshooting.md`, and covered by new harness scenarios `tests/scenarios/check-setup-block7-overlay-parser.sh` and `tests/scenarios/guard-block-overlay-source-parity.sh`.

### Fixed

- **Test harness: SIGPIPE-flaky assertions hardened** — every `producer | grep -q` idiom across `tests/scenarios/` (162 occurrences in 88 scenario files) was converted to the new SIGPIPE-safe helpers in `tests/lib/assert.sh` (`contains` / `contains_i` / `matches_re`), or to a here-string `grep -q[iE] … <<< "$var"` for multi-line and line-anchored patterns (which preserves grep's line-oriented semantics). This eliminates the intermittent CI failures where `grep -q` closed the pipe on first match and the upstream producer died with SIGPIPE (141) under `set -o pipefail`. The convention is documented as CONTRIBUTING.md rule 8 and in `tests/README.md` (Windows `HARNESS_JOBS=1` sequential-run notes). No runtime or Automation Config contract change — test infrastructure only.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **PR Rules: `Title format` optional key** — operators can now control the PR title shape via Automation Config using the placeholders `{issue-id}`, `{mode}`, and `{summary}`, with English/ASCII-only normalization (no spaces, no brackets, no colons, diacritics transliterated). When the key is omitted, the publisher falls back to `{issue-id} {Mode}: {summary}`. Parsed by `core/config-reader.md` as `pr_rules.title_format`, prompted by `/onboard`, documented in `docs/reference/automation-config.md`, and surfaced in all `examples/configs/*` templates.
- **publisher: PR-ownership defenses (Steps 6a/6b)** — the publisher now reads the new PR's `number`/`url` only from the create call's own response (Step 6a; a missing/`null`/error payload is a FAILED create that Blocks — never `previous + 1` guessing), and before any post-create mutation it verifies `pr.head.ref == current_branch` AND `pr.base.ref == base_branch`, treating a missing field as a mismatch and Blocking fail-closed (Step 6b). Two matching `NEVER` constraints were added. Prevents the publisher from PATCHing/DELETEing an unrelated PR after a malformed create-response.
- **Meaningful-test gate** — `test-engineer`, `fixer`, `reviewer`, and `acceptance-gate` (plus the review/test checklists) now reject "useless" tests: a test that would still pass if the change were reverted, re-implements the production logic, exercises an unchanged collaborator, or asserts nothing. When the changed code has no testable seam, the gate requires documenting the seam + manual/E2E verification rather than writing a hollow test.
- **Code-language convention** — `fixer`, `test-engineer`, `scaffolder`, and `reviewer` now keep code comments and identifiers in the project's established code language (national-language text only in user-facing strings), configurable via per-agent overlays or project CLAUDE.md prose.

### Changed

- **publisher: PR title is now config-driven** — the hardcoded mode-dependent title (`[PROJ-123] Fix: …`) is replaced by the `Title format` rule plus the `{issue-id} {Mode}: {summary}` fallback. The bracketed `[ISSUE-ID]` form remains only in git commit messages (Step 4), which are explicitly scoped as independent of the PR title. Consumers parsing the old `^\[ISSUE-ID\]` PR-title shape should update.
- **Source Control / PR Rules: English + ASCII-only identifiers** — branch descriptions and PR titles MUST be English and ASCII-only; non-English source text is translated first and any remaining diacritics transliterated.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **guard-block: missing `mcp__github__create_pull_request` in drift-guard rows** — all three rows
  (`fix-bugs`, `implement-feature`, `scaffold`) listed only `mcp__gitea__create_pull_request` in the
  `Before any…` enumeration; GitHub is the primary SC remote yet its PR-creation tool was absent,
  creating an exhaustiveness illusion that let a drifted model proceed unchecked.
- **guard-block: pre-publish hook (step 10) omitted from fix-bugs drift-guard row** — the Reality
  column mentioned only the post-publish hook; step 10 (pre-publish hook + custom agent) is also
  bypassed by direct VCS calls and is the higher-stakes gate.
- **guard-block: user-consent gates sentence missing from fix-bugs row** — `implement-feature` and
  `scaffold` rows both named the consent gates that were bypassed; `fix-bugs` was silent, making it
  the weakest guard of the three. Added "the triage pause and pre-publish checkpoints you skipped by
  drifting were the user-consent gates."
- **guard-block: ambiguous `or` path in all three drift-guard rows** — "STOP and ask the user — or
  get back on the dispatch table" let a drifted LLM interpret the `or` branch as a silent
  course-correction that requires no user interaction. Replaced with a single unambiguous imperative:
  "STOP and ask the user for explicit authorization — do not proceed with any VCS action without it."
- **guard-block: inconsistent trigger phrasing in scaffold row** — "user narrows scope" unified to
  "user gives narrow scope" for consistency with the other two files.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **scaffold: MCP restart loses pipeline state** — when scaffold's 0-MCP step detected a missing
  MCP server and the user chose "Configure now", no checkpoint was written before the STOP message,
  and the shared resume-detection phase-scan had no scaffold stage names in its regex, causing
  `RESUME_POINT = FRESH` on re-invocation. Fix: write
  `{ "mcp_setup_pending": true, "mcp_pause_step": "0-MCP", "status": "paused" }` to state.json
  atomically before emitting STOP (including `"status": "paused"` so resume-detection, webhooks, and
  autopilot Pause timeout all recognise the paused state correctly); fire `pipeline-paused` webhook;
  add a scaffold-specific post-resume check in `SKILL.md` that detects `mcp_setup_pending: true` and
  overrides `RESUME_POINT = "0-mcp"`, skipping 0-INFRA (already completed) and re-entering only
  0-MCP. "Skip" path now also explicitly clears the marker. New fields documented in
  `state/schema.md`. New harness scenario: `tests/scenarios/scaffold-mcp-pending-resume.sh`.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **CI: marketplace.json missing `"license": "MIT"`** — restored field that was incidentally dropped during a source-type refactor (was failing `cross-file-invariants` test)
- **CI flake: `backlog-creator-agent` and `scaffolder-e2e-batch` on Linux** — root cause was `producer | grep -q PATTERN` interacting with `set -o pipefail`: `grep -q` exits on first match and closes its stdin, the upstream `echo`/`sed` then receives SIGPIPE → exit 141 → `pipefail` propagates → `|| fail` triggers despite a successful match

### Added

- `tests/lib/assert.sh` — SIGPIPE-safe assertion helpers (`contains`, `contains_i`, `matches_re`) using bash builtins (`case`, `[[ ... =~ ]]`) instead of pipelines. New scenarios should prefer these helpers over `echo "$VAR" | grep -q PATTERN`.

### Infrastructure

- Branch protection enabled on `main`: required PR, required `Harness suite` status check, required up-to-date branches, no force-push, no deletions, includes administrators
