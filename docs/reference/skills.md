# Skills Reference

This reference covers all 17 skills in the agent-flow plugin. All 17 agent-flow skills are listed with syntax, descriptions, flags, and usage examples. Skills are the orchestration layer of the plugin — they define WHAT to do, while agents define HOW to do it (17 agents reference 17 core contracts).

## Conventions

- All skills are namespaced: `/agent-flow:<skill>`
- Skills read Automation Config from the consuming project's CLAUDE.md
- Skills dispatch agents via Claude Code's Task tool
- Skills contain zero project-specific logic — all configuration comes from Automation Config
- Publisher is never called automatically — the user decides when to publish
- Resume is automatic. To resume a paused pipeline, re-invoke the entry-point skill (`/fix-bugs`, `/implement-feature`, or `/scaffold`). To answer a NEEDS_CLARIFICATION question, add `--clarification "<answer>"` to the re-invocation.

## Bug-Fix Skills

### /analyze-bug

> Analyzes a specific bug from the issue tracker (analysis only, no code changes).

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:analyze-bug <ISSUE-ID>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<ISSUE-ID>` — Required. Ticket ID in the issue tracker.

**What it does:** Runs analyst (--phase triage) and analyst (--phase impact) on a specific bug. Produces a triage analysis and impact report without making any code changes, git operations, or issue tracker state updates. Useful for understanding a bug before deciding to fix it.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:analyze-bug PROJ-42
```

**Related skills:** [/fix-bugs](#fix-bugs)

---

### /autopilot

> Headless dispatcher for unattended cron / batch / CI invocation — reads Bug query / Feature query from Automation Config, classifies issues, and dispatches fix-bugs / implement-feature. Lock-file protected.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:autopilot [--dry-run]
```

**Flags:**
- `--dry-run` — Full short-circuit: print what would be processed, no lock, no dispatch, no state writes

**What it does:** Reads `### Issue Tracker`, `### Feature Workflow` (optional), and `### Autopilot` (optional) from `## Automation Config`, fetches issues via the tracker MCP, classifies them as bugs or features, and dispatches `fix-bugs` or `implement-feature` per issue sequentially via the Skill tool. Acquires a portable `mkdir`-based lock (`.agent-flow/autopilot.lock/`) to prevent concurrent runs on the same host. Produces a summary table with outcome, duration, and token usage per issue. Typically invoked headlessly:

```bash
claude -p "Run /agent-flow:autopilot" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Exit codes:** `0` = all dispatched, `1` = preflight/config failure, `2` = lock held, `3` = MCP unreachable.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:autopilot --dry-run
```

### /fix-bugs

> Analyzes and fixes issues — single ticket (\<ISSUE-ID\>) or batch (--batch \<N\>).

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:fix-bugs <ISSUE-ID> [--dry-run] [--decompose | --no-decompose] [--profile <name>] [--yolo | --step-mode] [--clarification "<answer>"]
/agent-flow:fix-bugs --batch <N> [--dry-run] [--decompose | --no-decompose] [--profile <name>] [--yolo | --step-mode]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<ISSUE-ID>` — Single-ticket mode. Ticket ID in the issue tracker (e.g., `PROJ-42`, or numeric ID on github/gitea/redmine).
- `--batch <N>` — Batch mode. Number of bugs to process from the Bug query.

**Argument auto-detection:** Bare-integer arguments are interpreted as ISSUE-ID on numeric trackers (github/gitea/redmine) and as batch count on string trackers (youtrack/jira/linear). On string trackers, a disambiguation warning is emitted. Use `--batch <N>` explicitly for unambiguous batch invocation (recommended in scripts/CI).

**Flags:**
- `--dry-run` — Run triage and code analysis only, no side effects
- `--decompose` — Force decomposition into subtasks
- `--no-decompose` — Disable decomposition (always single-pass)
- `--profile <name>` — Apply a pipeline profile from Automation Config
- `--yolo` — Skip all confirmations, auto-approve and auto-publish (mutually exclusive with `--step-mode`)
- `--step-mode` — Pause after every pipeline step for manual review before continuing (mutually exclusive with `--yolo`)
- `--clarification "<answer>"` — Provide the human answer to a paused-pipeline NEEDS_CLARIFICATION question and resume from the paused point. Single-ticket mode only.

**What it does:** Runs the full bug-fix pipeline. In single-ticket mode, processes one issue end-to-end (triage → code analysis → fix → review → test → publish). In batch mode (`--batch <N>`), queries the issue tracker using the Bug query from Automation Config and processes up to N bugs through the full pipeline; supports parallel processing via worktrees when the Worktrees section is configured. On every invocation, automatically detects in-progress pipelines for the target ISSUE-ID via `.agent-flow/{ISSUE-ID}/state.json` and prompts to resume.

**Examples:**

```
/agent-flow:fix-bugs PROJ-42 --dry-run
/agent-flow:fix-bugs --batch 5 --profile fast
/agent-flow:fix-bugs PROJ-42 --clarification "Use option B"
```

## Feature Skills

### /implement-feature

> Implements a feature from the issue tracker — spec, design, fix, review, test, publish.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:implement-feature <ISSUE-ID> [--dry-run] [--decompose | --no-decompose] [--profile <name>] [--yolo | --step-mode]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<ISSUE-ID>` — Required. Feature issue ID in the tracker.

**Flags:**
- `--dry-run` — Run spec analysis and architecture design only, no side effects
- `--decompose` — Force decomposition into subtasks
- `--no-decompose` — Disable decomposition (single-pass)
- `--profile <name>` — Apply a pipeline profile from Automation Config
- `--yolo` — Skip all confirmations, auto-approve decomposition and auto-publish (mutually exclusive with `--step-mode`)
- `--step-mode` — Pause after every pipeline step for manual review before continuing (mutually exclusive with `--yolo`)

**What it does:** Runs the full feature pipeline: spec-analyst extracts requirements, architect designs the solution and optionally decomposes it into subtasks, then fixer/reviewer/test-engineer execute each subtask. The user confirms the decomposition plan before execution starts. After all subtasks pass, the result is presented for publishing. When decomposition is active, creates corresponding tracker sub-issues under the parent issue before executing subtasks (configurable via `Create tracker subtasks` in Decomposition config).

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:implement-feature PROJ-50 --decompose
```

## Scaffold Skills

### /scaffold

> Creates a new project from scratch. Modes: default (brainstorm-if-vague + 2 checkpoints) / `--yolo` (autonomous, no confirmation gates) / `--step-mode` (pause after each pipeline step).

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:scaffold <description> [--template <path>] [--spec <path>] [--issue <ID>] [--no-implement] [--yolo | --step-mode] [--lang <language>] [--framework <framework>] [--db <database>] [--ci <provider>]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<description>` — Required (unless --spec, --template, or --issue provided). Natural language description of the project.

**Flags:**
- `--template <path>` — Use a custom specification template
- `--spec <path>` — Use a ready specification (skip spec-writer, spec-reviewer validates)
- `--issue <ID>` — Read project description from issue tracker card
- `--no-implement` — Skeleton only, no specification or feature implementation (v3.x behavior)
- `--yolo` — Skip all confirmation gates, run fully autonomously (mutually exclusive with `--step-mode`)
- `--step-mode` — Pause after every pipeline step for manual review (mutually exclusive with `--yolo`)
- `--lang <language>` — Preset language (e.g., `python`, `typescript`)
- `--framework <framework>` — Preset framework (e.g., `fastapi`, `express`)
- `--db <database>` — Preset database (e.g., `postgresql`, `mongodb`)
- `--ci <provider>` — Preset CI provider (e.g., `github`, `gitea`)

**Input source flags** (`--spec`, `--template`, `--issue`) are mutually exclusive. Tech stack flags (`--lang`, `--framework`, `--db`, `--ci`) are compatible with all input sources.

**What it does:** Scaffolds a new project end-to-end. In **default mode**, spec-writer generates a project specification (with optional brainstorm phase when description is vague), a spec-reviewer quality gate runs, scaffolder generates the skeleton with auto-configured CLAUDE.md, and the feature pipeline (architect → fixer/reviewer/test-engineer) implements all features from the spec. Two human confirmation checkpoints: after spec and after scaffold. With **`--yolo`**, all confirmation gates are skipped and the pipeline runs autonomously. With **`--step-mode`**, execution pauses after every step for manual review before continuing. After git init, the scaffold pushes to the declared remote (Step 4d) and creates tracker issues from spec epics (Step 4e) when infrastructure is ready. The `--issue` flag auto-detects tracker availability. With `--no-implement`, falls back to skeleton-only behavior: scaffolder (with stack flags) → skeleton → push (if SC ready).

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:scaffold "REST API for user management with auth and roles" --lang python
```

**Note:** Use `--no-implement` for v3.x skeleton-only behavior without specification or feature implementation.

**Adding components to an existing project:** Use `/agent-flow:scaffold add <component>` (subcommand of `/scaffold`) where `<component>` is one of `claude-md`, `ci`, `docker`, `tests`. For example, `/agent-flow:scaffold add ci` adds a CI workflow file to the current project. Unknown components produce `[ERROR] Unknown component: {NAME}` and exit 1.

## Publishing Skills

### /publish

> Creates a PR and updates issue tracker states.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:publish
```

**What it does:** Dispatches the publisher agent to create a PR with the full template, apply labels, and update the issue tracker state according to State transitions in Automation Config. This is the same publishing step that runs at the end of fix-bugs and implement-feature, but available as a standalone skill.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:publish
```

**Related skills:** [/fix-bugs](#fix-bugs)

---

## Configuration Skills

### /onboard

> Interactive wizard for generating Automation Config.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:onboard
```

**What it does:** Launches an interactive wizard that asks about your project setup: issue tracker type, instance URL, project key, source control remote, build/test commands, and more. Generates a complete Automation Config block that can be added to your project's CLAUDE.md. Supports all 6 tracker types (YouTrack, GitHub, Jira, Linear, Gitea, Redmine).

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:onboard
```

**Related skills:** [/setup-mcp](#setup-mcp), [/check-setup](#check-setup)

---

### /setup-mcp

> Configures developer environment — MCP servers, tokens, and permissions.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:setup-mcp
/agent-flow:setup-mcp --update
/agent-flow:setup-mcp --tracker-type <type> [--tracker-instance <url>] [--sc-remote <owner/repo>]
```

**Flags:**
- `--update` — Update existing configuration, preserving non-agent-flow servers
- `--tracker-type <type>` — Override tracker type. Bypasses CLAUDE.md read.
- `--tracker-instance <url>` — Override tracker instance URL. Defaults to type-specific default.
- `--sc-remote <owner/repo>` — Override SC remote. Omit for tracker-only setup.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Input | (none), `--update`, or CLI override flags |
| Output | `.mcp.json`, `.mcp.json.example`, `.claude/settings.json` |
| Destructive | Yes (writes files) |
| MCP required | Yes (for connectivity validation) |

**What it does:** Sets up the developer environment for agent-flow. Reads your Automation Config to determine which MCP servers and tokens are needed, guides you through token collection, generates `.mcp.json` with proper server configuration, and optionally sets up tool permissions in `.claude/settings.json`. Creates `.mcp.json.example` for team sharing (without secrets).

When CLI override flags are provided (`--tracker-type`, `--tracker-instance`, `--sc-remote`), setup-mcp bypasses the Automation Config read entirely. This enables setup-mcp to run before CLAUDE.md exists — for example, during scaffold when the project has no configuration yet.

**Examples:**

```
/agent-flow:setup-mcp
```

```
/agent-flow:setup-mcp --tracker-type gitea --tracker-instance https://git.example.com --sc-remote myorg/myproject
```

### /check-setup

> Validate Automation Config, MCP servers, and tokens.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:check-setup [--skip-build]
```

**Flags:**
- `--skip-build` — Skip the build and test command validation

**What it does:** Performs a comprehensive validation of your agent-flow setup. Checks that all required Automation Config sections and keys are present, values are not placeholders, table format is correct, MCP servers matching the tracker type are available, and build/test commands execute successfully. Reports pass/fail for each validation block with actionable fix suggestions.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:check-setup --skip-build
```

**Related skills:** [/onboard](#onboard)

---

### /setup-agents

> One-shot project scanner that generates smart customization/*.toml defaults per agent.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:setup-agents [--dry-run] [--yolo] [--force]
```

**Flags:**
- `--dry-run` — Preview the generated `.toml` files without writing them
- `--yolo` — Write files without asking for confirmation
- `--force` — Overwrite existing `.toml` files (default: skip files that don't have `# generated:` header, preserving manual edits)

**What it does:** Scans the consuming project to detect project type (Python, TypeScript, monorepo, Java, Rust, .NET, test framework) and generates smart `customization/{agent}.toml` default overlays for each applicable agent. Generated files include a `# generated: agent-flow setup-agents` header that marks them as safe to overwrite on subsequent runs. Files without this header (manually edited or created) are never overwritten unless `--force` is used. After scan, displays a preview diff of all files to be created or updated, then asks for confirmation (unless `--yolo`).

TOML overlay syntax and the 3-tier merge contract are documented in `core/overlay/toml-overlay.md`. Full heuristic enumeration and worked examples: `docs/guides/setup-agents-skill.md`.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:setup-agents --dry-run
/agent-flow:setup-agents --yolo
```

## Monitoring Skills

### /metrics

> Pipeline analytics report — success rates, per-agent effectiveness.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:metrics [--period <N>] [--output <path>] [--format <md|json>]
```

**Flags:**
- `--period <N>` — Analysis period in days (default: 30)
- `--output <path>` — Output file path (default: stdout)
- `--format <md|json>` — Output format: markdown or JSON (default: md)

**What it does:** Generates a pipeline analytics report covering success rates, per-agent effectiveness, common failure patterns, and trend data. Analyzes `[agent-flow]` comments and PR history to compute metrics. Useful for identifying bottleneck agents and tuning retry limits.

**Pipeline history file:** `.agent-flow/pipeline-history.md` is an append-only run log written after every pipeline completion. It contains metadata only — fields: `run_id`, `date`, `pipeline`, `outcome`, `agents_touched`, `block_agent`, `block_step`, `block_reason` (sanitized via 18-pattern credential redaction; v6.9.1 added bare-keyword variable redaction). The fixer agent reads the last 5 entries and the reviewer agent reads the last 10 entries at Step 1 to inform their decisions. Full contract: see `core/post-publish-hook.md` Section 5. For `.gitignore` guidance see [docs/guides/installation.md § Pipeline State and .gitignore](../guides/installation.md#4-pipeline-state-and-gitignore).

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:metrics --period 14 --format json --output metrics.json
```

## Planning Skills

### /prioritize

> Analyzes backlog and suggests fix order using AI prioritization.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:prioritize [--limit <N>] [--output <path>]
```

**Flags:**
- `--limit <N>` — Maximum number of issues to analyze (default: 50)
- `--output <path>` — Output file path (default: stdout)

**What it does:** Dispatches the priority-engine agent to analyze the issue backlog and produce a ranked prioritization. Issues are scored using the formula `(Impact x 2 + Risk x 1.5) / Effort + dependency_bonus` and grouped into P0/P1/P2 tiers. Includes a dependency graph and batch recommendation for the highest-priority issues.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:prioritize --limit 20 --output priority-report.md
```

**Related skills:** [/fix-bugs](#fix-bugs), [/metrics](#metrics)

---

### /create-backlog

> Creates backlog epics in issue tracker from a specification document

**Syntax:** `/agent-flow:create-backlog <spec-path> [flags]`

**Arguments:**
- `<spec-path>` — Path to spec file, spec/ folder, or multiple files

**Flags:**
- `--decompose` — After epic creation, dispatch architect for subtask decomposition
- `--update` — Match existing tracker issues by title, update instead of create
- `--dry-run` — Display epic preview without creating tracker issues
- `--yolo` — Auto-approve human confirmation gates

**What it does:**
1. Reads specification files and dispatches backlog-creator agent
2. Displays epic preview table (title, AC count, size, dependencies)
3. Creates epic issues in tracker after human confirmation
4. Optionally decomposes epics into subtasks via architect agent

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:create-backlog spec/
/agent-flow:create-backlog spec/epics/auth.md --update
/agent-flow:create-backlog spec/ --decompose --yolo
```

**Related skills:** [/sprint-plan](#sprint-plan), [/implement-feature](#implement-feature), [/prioritize](#prioritize)

---

### /sprint-plan

> Plans a sprint from backlog issues using capacity constraints and priority ranking

**Syntax:** `/agent-flow:sprint-plan [flags]`

**Flags:**
- `--all` — Plan all sprints (release plan), not just the next one
- `--apply` — After planning, dispatch /implement-feature per selected issue
- `--dry-run` — Display plan without tracker writes
- `--limit <N>` — Override max issues to consider (default: 20)
- `--yolo` — Auto-approve Gates 1 and 3 (Gate 2 always blocks)

**What it does:**
1. Fetches open issues from tracker
2. Dispatches priority-engine for ranking (P0/P1/P2 tiers)
3. Dispatches sprint-planner for capacity-constrained selection
4. Three human gates: capacity confirmation, AC coverage check, final approval
5. Assigns selected issues to sprint in tracker
6. Optionally dispatches implementation pipeline per issue

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:sprint-plan
/agent-flow:sprint-plan --all
/agent-flow:sprint-plan --apply --yolo
/agent-flow:sprint-plan --dry-run --limit 10
```

## Versioning Skills

### /version-check

> Compares installed plugin version with latest available.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:version-check
```

**What it does:** Works from any directory. Reads the installed plugin version from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` and compares it with the latest version tag on the remote repository. Reports whether an update is available. When run from the plugin's own repo directory, also compares the repo version with the installed version. Provides clear reinstall instructions when versions are stale.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:version-check
```

**Related skills:** [/changelog](#changelog)

---

### /changelog

> Automatic changelog generation from merged PRs.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:changelog
```

**What it does:** Scans merged pull requests since the last git tag, categorizes changes (Fixed, Improved, Added, Changed), and generates a CHANGELOG.md entry for the current version. Uses PR titles and descriptions to produce meaningful changelog entries.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:changelog
```

**Related skills:** [/version-check](#version-check)

---

## Discussion Skills

### /discuss

> Multi-agent discussion — explores a topic or issue with multiple agent perspectives.

**Syntax:**

```
/agent-flow:discuss <topic>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<topic>` — Required. Topic, question, or issue ID to discuss.

**What it does:** Facilitates a structured multi-agent discussion on a given topic or issue. Multiple agents contribute their perspective (e.g., reviewer raises concerns, architect proposes approaches, spec-analyst clarifies scope). Useful for exploring complex decisions, reviewing tradeoffs, or getting multi-perspective analysis before committing to an approach.

**Example:**

```
/agent-flow:discuss "Should we migrate the auth module to JWT?"
```

**Related skills:** [/analyze-bug](#analyze-bug)
