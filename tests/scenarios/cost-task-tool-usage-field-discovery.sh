# AC-38: Task-tool usage-field discovery test (COST-R12)
# Traces: COST-R2, COST-R12
# Description: Runs a structural assertion that verifies what token-count field name
#              the Task tool reports. Per spec, Phase 5 must create this file and assert
#              the field matches the known allowlist: {total_tokens, input_tokens+output_tokens,
#              tokens_estimated}.
#
# IMPORTANT: This test performs a STRUCTURAL stub (no live Claude CLI call in CI).
# It simulates the discovery by reading the spec-mandated field name from Phase 7 implementation.
# When running with a live Claude CLI (CLAUDE_LIVE_TEST=1), it performs the actual Task dispatch.
#
# The structured summary line DISCOVERED_FIELD={name} is the mechanical signal for Phase 7.

# Discovery context: The Claude Task tool returns a result object with a `result.usage` field
# that contains token counts. The field name within result.usage may vary by Claude API version:
# - result.usage.total_tokens (most common)
# - result.usage.input_tokens + result.usage.output_tokens (computed sum)
# - result.usage.tokens_estimated (fallback when exact count unavailable)
# This test asserts which field name from result.usage the implementation reads.
# DISCOVERED_FIELD= emits the chosen field name as a structured summary line.

# Known token-count field allowlist
ALLOWLIST=(total_tokens "input_tokens+output_tokens" tokens_estimated)

# --- Structural stub path (CI / no Claude CLI) ---
# Read the discovered field from state-manager.md or metrics/SKILL.md
# (Phase 7 implementation documents the chosen field name)
