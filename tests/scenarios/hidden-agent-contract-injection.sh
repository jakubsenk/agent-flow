# Test:        v10-hidden-agent-contract-injection.sh (HIDDEN)
# What it checks (for a deterministic 3-agent sample, picking files that span
# the role spectrum: fixer (execution), reviewer (read-only), publisher (haiku)):
#   1) The '## Step Completion Invariants' section, after extraction, has
#      between 10 and 50 non-empty lines (size sanity — neither stub nor bloated).
#   2) The section opens with a directive sentence (first non-blank line is
#      a complete sentence: contains 'SHALL' or 'MUST' or 'shall' or 'must'
#      OR ends with a period and is ≥40 chars long). Pure bullet-only sections
#      fail; section must lead with prose.
#   3) The section explicitly references the agent's stage_name binding.
#      For fixer, stage = `fixer_reviewer`. For reviewer, stage = `fixer_reviewer`.
#      For publisher, stage = `publisher`. The section MUST contain the literal
#      stage name as a backticked token within the section body.
# Falsification angle this catches that the visible test does not:
#   - Section present but is a one-liner stub.
#   - Section present but is bullet-only (no directive prose).
#   - Section present but missing the agent-stage binding mentioned
#     per-agent stage-name mapping table.
# Expected RED phase: FAIL — section does not yet exist on any agent.
# Expected GREEN phase: PASS.
