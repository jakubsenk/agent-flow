# Check Setup

Check the project configuration for the agent-flow pipeline. Report: what works, what is missing, what failed.

If $ARGUMENTS contains `--skip-build`, skip running build/test commands.

## Steps

### Block 1: Automation Config (structural check)

1. Read the current project's CLAUDE.md
2. Verify the existence of the `## Automation Config` section → [OK] or [FAIL]
3. Verify required sections and keys:

| Section | Required keys |
|---------|--------------|
| Issue Tracker | Type (or default youtrack), Instance, Project, Bug query, State transitions, On start set |
| Source Control | Remote, Base branch, Branch naming |
| PR Rules | Labels |
| PR Description Template | (subsection present) |
| Build & Test | Build command, Test command |

### 3a. Per-tracker validation

> **Path note:** `trackers.md` lives in the plugin installation directory, not in the consuming
> project. Glob is used to handle CWD-context mismatch.

Locate `trackers.md`: Glob with pattern `.claude/plugins/**/docs/reference/trackers.md` first.
If no results, Glob with `**/docs/reference/trackers.md`. If still none, try `docs/reference/trackers.md` relative to CWD.
If multiple results, prefer the path containing `.claude/plugins/` or `agent-flow/`; if ambiguous → [WARN] "Multiple trackers.md found — using {path}."
If the file cannot be found → [WARN] "trackers.md not found — per-tracker validation skipped. Verify plugin installation." and skip the rest of Step 3a.
Find the row matching the configured Type in the Validation Rules table.

- Apply the query validation rule for that tracker to the Bug query value
- Apply the state transition format check to the State transitions value
- Apply the instance validation rule (if any) to the Instance value
- For unknown Type → [WARN] "Unknown tracker type '{Type}'. Validation skipped."

4. For each key: verify that the value exists and is NOT a placeholder (`<...>`)
   - Present and filled → [OK]
   - Empty or placeholder → [FAIL]

5. Verify optional sections (if they exist, check the format):
   - Retry Limits, Hooks, Custom Agents, Notifications, Worktrees, E2E Test, Error Handling, Decomposition, Pipeline Profiles, Metrics, Feature Workflow, Local Deployment
   - Exists and correct format → [OK]
   - Does not exist → [SKIP] (optional)
   - Exists but incorrect format → [WARN]
   - Local Deployment (if present): Type must be `docker` or `native` → [WARN] if neither; Start command and Stop command must be non-empty → [WARN] if missing

### Block 2: MCP servers (presence and connectivity)

6. Read `.mcp.json` in the project root:
   - Found → [OK]
   - NOT found in CWD → search parent directories (up to git root or 3 levels):
     - Found at {path} → [WARN] ".mcp.json found at {path}, but Claude Code loads from CWD ({cwd}). Copy or symlink it here."
     - Not found anywhere → [FAIL] "No .mcp.json found. Run /agent-flow:setup-mcp to create one."

7. Compare MCP servers with Automation Config:
   - Issue tracker MCP: reuse the trackers.md path resolved in Step 3a (do not Glob again).
     Read the MCP Server Detection table. Find the row matching Type.
     Search .mcp.json server names/URLs for the listed keywords.
     If trackers.md was unavailable in Step 3a → [WARN] "trackers.md not found — MCP server keyword match skipped."
   - If match → [OK] "Issue tracker MCP: {server_name} ({type})"
   - If no match → [FAIL] "No MCP server configured for tracker type '{type}'. Run /agent-flow:setup-mcp to set it up."
   - Source control MCP: match server names/URLs with Remote from config
   - If match → [OK]
   - If no match → [FAIL] "No MCP server configured for source control '{remote}'"

8. Verify that tokens in `.mcp.json` are not empty or placeholders → [OK] or [FAIL]
   - If tracker Type is `gitea` AND `.mcp.json` contains a `command` field referencing `forgejo-mcp`: emit `[WARN] forgejo-mcp detected in .mcp.json for Type: gitea — re-run /agent-flow:setup-mcp to install gitea-mcp.`

### Block 3: Connectivity

9. Run the Bug query from Automation Config via MCP (limit 1 result):
   - Success → [OK] with the number of bugs found
   - On failure, classify the error in this order:
     1. **TLS error** (error contains any of: UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE, CERT_UNTRUSTED,
        SELF_SIGNED_CERT, self signed certificate, certificate verify failed, ERR_TLS_,
        DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT, unable to get local issuer certificate):
        Run a curl probe to confirm network reachability:
        - Check `which curl` — if curl is not available, skip probe and emit:
          [FAIL] "Issue tracker — TLS error detected. Add NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca to .mcp.json env block. (curl not available for confirmation probe)"
        - Run: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 {Instance}`
        - curl exit 0 and HTTP code != 000 →
          [FAIL] "Issue tracker — server reachable but MCP connection failed (likely TLS) — add NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca to the env block in .mcp.json"
        - curl exit non-zero or HTTP code 000 →
          [FAIL] "Issue tracker — connection failed (TLS or network). If using a private CA, try NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca. If server is remote, verify URL."
     2. **Auth error** (error contains: 401, 403, unauthorized, forbidden, invalid token, authentication) →
        [FAIL] "Issue tracker — authentication failed — check your token in .mcp.json"
     3. **Any other error** →
        [FAIL] "Issue tracker — server not reachable — verify the server is running and URL is correct. If using a private CA (self-signed or corporate PKI), also try NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca."
10. Verify source control connectivity: fetch metadata for the configured Remote (owner/repo) via MCP
    - Use MCP to fetch repository metadata for the Remote value from Automation Config
    - Success → [OK] "Source control — {owner/repo} reachable"
    - On failure, classify the error in this order:
      1. **TLS error** (error contains any of: UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE, CERT_UNTRUSTED,
         SELF_SIGNED_CERT, self signed certificate, certificate verify failed, ERR_TLS_,
         DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT, unable to get local issuer certificate):
         Derive {sc_base_url}: scan the SC MCP server entry in .mcp.json for a URL-like value
         in the `env` block (first value starting with `https://` or `http://`). If no URL found,
         check if the server command/package matches a well-known host (server-github → https://github.com,
         server-gitlab → https://gitlab.com). If neither yields a URL, skip the curl probe.
         If {sc_base_url} was derived, run a curl probe:
         - Check `which curl` — if curl is not available, skip probe and emit:
           [FAIL] "Source control — TLS error detected. Add NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca to .mcp.json env block. (curl not available for confirmation probe)"
         - Run: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 {sc_base_url}`
         - curl exit 0 and HTTP code != 000 →
           [FAIL] "Source control — server reachable but MCP connection failed (likely TLS) — add NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca to the env block in .mcp.json"
         - curl exit non-zero or HTTP code 000 →
           [FAIL] "Source control — connection failed (TLS or network). If using a private CA, try NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca. If server is remote, verify URL."
         If {sc_base_url} could not be derived (skip probe):
           [FAIL] "Source control — TLS error detected. If using a private CA (self-signed or corporate PKI), add NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca to the env block in .mcp.json."
      2. **Auth error** (401/403) →
         [FAIL] "Source control — authentication failed. Token needs repository:read scope (Gitea), repo scope (GitHub), or read_repository scope (GitLab)."
      3. **Not found** (404) →
         [FAIL] "Source control — repository {owner/repo} not found. Verify Remote in Automation Config."
      4. **Tool not found** (MCP server lacks repository metadata method) →
         [WARN] "Source control MCP: repository existence check not supported — skipping."
      5. **Any other error** →
         [FAIL] "Source control — MCP server not reachable. Verify server URL and token in .mcp.json. If using a private CA (self-signed or corporate PKI), also try NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca."

### Block 4: Build & Test (optional)

11. If `--skip-build` is NOT in $ARGUMENTS:
    - Run Build command → [OK] or [FAIL]
    - Run Test command → [OK] or [FAIL]
12. If `--skip-build` IS in $ARGUMENTS → [SKIP]

### Block 4b: Docker dry-build (optional)

13. Docker dry-build check:

```bash
# Block 4b: Docker dry-build (optional)
if [ -n "$skip_build" ] && [ "$skip_build" = "true" ]; then
  echo "[SKIP] Docker - skipped (--skip-build flag)"
elif [ ! -f Dockerfile ]; then
  echo "[SKIP] Docker - no Dockerfile"
elif ! command -v docker >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "[SKIP] Docker - docker binary not found"
else
  # NOTE: --skip-build flag handled at top of block (skips Docker check identically to other build steps)
  if docker build --no-cache -t check-setup-test . > /tmp/check-setup-docker.log 2>&1; then
    echo "[OK] Docker - build passed"
    docker rmi check-setup-test >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  else
    err=$(tail -3 /tmp/check-setup-docker.log | tr '\n' ' ')
    echo "[FAIL] Docker - $err"
  fi
fi
```

Where `$skip_build` is set to `"true"` when `--skip-build` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` (same flag used by Block 4). The 4-branch decision tree:
- `--skip-build` flag → `[SKIP] Docker - skipped (--skip-build flag)`
- No Dockerfile present → `[SKIP] Docker - no Dockerfile`
- `docker` binary not on PATH → `[SKIP] Docker - docker binary not found` (handles CI environments without Docker)
- Docker build exits 0 → `[OK] Docker - build passed` (image cleaned up with `docker rmi`)
- Docker build exits non-zero → `[FAIL] Docker - {last 3 lines of build log}`

## Output format

```
## Setup report — {Remote from Automation Config}

### Automation Config
[OK]   ## Automation Config found in CLAUDE.md
[OK]   Issue Tracker — all keys filled (Type: {type})
[OK]   Source Control — all keys filled
[FAIL] PR Description Template — section missing
[FAIL] Build & Test — Test command is empty

### MCP servers
[OK]   .mcp.json found
[OK]   Issue tracker MCP server configured ({instance})
[FAIL] Source control MCP server not found for remote {owner/repo}

### Connectivity
[OK]   Issue tracker — connection OK, project {PROJECT} found, X bugs
[FAIL] Issue tracker — server reachable but MCP connection failed (likely TLS) — add NODE_OPTIONS: --use-system-ca to the env block in .mcp.json
[FAIL] Source control — authentication failed. Token needs repository:read scope.

### Build & Test
[SKIP] Skipped (--skip-build)

### Docker
[SKIP] Docker - no Dockerfile

---
Result: {N} FAIL, {M} WARN — {verdict}
```

Verdict:
- No FAILs → "Configuration is complete. Pipeline is ready."
- At least one FAIL → "Pipeline CANNOT run. Fix the errors listed above."

### Block 5: Plugin Composability

13. Check installed plugins:
    - Look for plugin registry: `.claude/plugins.json`, `.claude-plugins`, or another file with plugin metadata (exact location depends on the Claude Code version — if none of these files exist → [SKIP] "Plugin registry not found — conflict detection skipped")
    - If found: read the list of installed plugins
    - For each plugin: check if it registers commands with the same base name as agent-flow commands (without namespace prefix)
    - If conflict → [WARN] "Plugin '{name}' registers command '{cmd}' which may conflict with agent-flow:{cmd}"
    - If no conflicts → [OK] "No plugin conflicts detected"

### Block 6: Dispatch Enforcement Hook (advisory)

14. Check whether the dispatch enforcement hook is installed:
    a. Verify that `hooks/validate-dispatch.sh` exists in the plugin installation directory.
       - Glob with `.claude/plugins/**/hooks/validate-dispatch.sh`; if not found, try `hooks/validate-dispatch.sh` relative to CWD.
       - Found → [OK] "hooks/validate-dispatch.sh present at {path}"
       - Not found → [ADVISORY] "hooks/validate-dispatch.sh not found — dispatch audit not available"
    b. Check whether `~/.claude/settings.json` contains a PostToolUse hook entry referencing `validate-dispatch`.
       - Read `~/.claude/settings.json` (if accessible).
       - Found entry referencing `validate-dispatch` → [OK] "PostToolUse hook wired in ~/.claude/settings.json"
       - Not found or file unreadable → [ADVISORY] "PostToolUse hook not configured — dispatch enforcement is opt-in. See docs/guides/dispatch-enforcement.md to install."
    c. All results in this block are advisory — they NEVER contribute to the FAIL count or change the final verdict.

## Deprecated v6.x config detection

After all primary checks complete, scan for v7.0.0 deprecated config sections and emit advisories. These do NOT change the exit code — they're warnings only.

```bash
# Deprecated section detector (v7.0.0)
if grep -q '^### Extra labels' "$CLAUDE_MD" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "[WARN] Deprecated config section detected: ### Extra labels"
  echo "       Removed in v7.0.0. Move any labels into ### PR Rules → Labels"
  echo "       (which fully supports the use case). See CHANGELOG.md."
fi
```

This warning does NOT change the exit code (no `exit 1`, no `FAIL`, no `fail()`, no `return 1`). It is purely advisory.

## Rules

- Read-only — never write to CLAUDE.md or the issue tracker
- Connectivity: read-only MCP queries only
- Placeholder detection: pattern `<...>` in values = FAIL
- Safe for repeated execution
