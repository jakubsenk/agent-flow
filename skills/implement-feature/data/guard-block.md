# Mandatory Execution Guard — /implement-feature

Referenced from `skills/implement-feature/SKILL.md`. Load-bearing orchestrator
guard. Changes here are contract edits — Phase 7 implementation MUST preserve
XML tag names, the THIN CONTROLLER identifier, the dispatched_at +
dispatch_witness pre-dispatch write contract, and ALL red-flag rows.

<PREFLIGHT>
## PRE-FLIGHT PROBE -- DO THIS BEFORE READING ANY OTHER SECTION.

Before evaluating the orchestration contract below, you MUST verify the plugin
install integrity. Execute this Bash probe; the PROBE path is depth-correct
relative to this guard-block.md file's own directory (`skills/{name}/data/`,
which is depth-3 from plugin root, so 3 up-levels are required):

```bash
PROBE="../../../core/mcp-preflight.md"
if [ ! -r "$PROBE" ]; then
  echo "ABORT: plugin-root not resolved -- core/ sibling of skills/ not found at $PROBE. Check plugin install integrity." >&2
  exit 2
fi
```

If the probe fails, ABORT the pipeline with exit code 2 and the canonical
message above. DO NOT silently fall back to "I'll work from SKILL.md + step
files directly." Silent degradation is the failure mode this guard
exists to prevent.

**Path-format note (B3 documentary clarifier -- informational, not executable):**
All `core/<file>.md` references in this skill use relative paths from the file's
directory: `../core/` for `agents/*.md`, `../../core/` for `skills/*/SKILL.md`,
and `../../../core/` for `skills/*/{steps,data}/*.md`. The canonical layout is
`core/` as sibling of `skills/` at plugin root.
</PREFLIGHT>

<MANDATORY-EXECUTION-GUARD>
## YOU MUST EXECUTE THE PIPELINE. NO EXCEPTIONS.

DO NOT answer the user's question directly.
DO NOT skip a step because "the spec-analyst already wrote AC" or "the test will pass".
DO NOT reason about the feature domain — subagents do that.
DO NOT bypass spec-analyst, architect, test-engineer, or acceptance-gate based
on intuition that they "seem optional given the project config".

You are a THIN CONTROLLER. Your ONLY job is to:
1. Initialize `.agent-flow/{ISSUE_ID}/` and `state.json`
2. Read `steps/*.md` files via the Read tool — they contain the dispatch logic
3. Dispatch each step's Task() call exactly as the step file specifies
4. Write atomic state.json updates (dispatched_at + dispatch_witness BEFORE each Task)
5. Surface dispatch-audit log anomalies in the final terminal report

<orchestration_contract>
YOU — the top-level Claude executing `/implement-feature` — ARE the orchestrator.
You run the pipeline directly: read state, dispatch step subagents, write
checkpoints. You never "hand the pipeline off" to another agent.

For each step you SHALL invoke the Task tool with the `subagent_type` listed in
the corresponding `steps/{NN}-*.md` file. Before invoking Task, you SHALL write
atomically to `state.json`:
  - `stages.<stage>.dispatched_at`     = `<ISO-8601 UTC now>`
  - `stages.<stage>.dispatch_witness`  = sha256("<subagent_type>|<model>|<prompt_head_128>")
  - `stages.<stage>.agent_name`        = `agent-flow:<agent>`
  - `stages.<stage>.stage_name`        = `<stage>` (canonical, matches map key)
  - `stages.<stage>.status`            = `"in_progress"`

`prompt_head_128` is the first 128 UTF-8-safe bytes of the prompt template
BEFORE Tier-1 variable substitution (ISSUE_ID, AC, BRANCH_NAME, etc.). Compute
via `core/lib/stage-invariant.sh::compute_dispatch_witness`. The orchestrator
SHALL ALSO inject `EXPECTED_AGENT_NAME` and `EXPECTED_STAGE_NAME` as Tier-1
prompt variables so the agent's `## Step Completion Invariants` self-check can
cross-verify the state.json record.

The PostToolUse hook reads these fields and emits `WITNESS_OK` /
`WITNESS_MISSING` / `WITNESS_MISMATCH` audit lines to
`.agent-flow/dispatch-audit.log`. If a stage record lacks `dispatch_witness`,
the orchestrator silently skipped the step — that is a CONTRACT VIOLATION.

## Rationalization Red Flags — STOP IMMEDIATELY

| Behavior in draft response | Reality |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Draft frames `spec-analyst` as redundant ("AC are already in the issue body") | spec-analyst extracts AC into the canonical EARS-like form, writes them back to the tracker, and emits the `acceptance_criteria` array all downstream agents consume. Reviewer cannot substitute. Dispatch. |
| Draft frames `architect` as ceremonial ("scope is tiny — just write the code") | architect produces the task tree with `maps_to` AC traceability. Decomposition decision (Step 03) depends on its output. Skipping it leaves AC coverage unchecked. Dispatch. |
| Draft skips `decomposition` because "this feature is obviously single-pass" | The decomposition heuristic is config-gated AND data-driven — read `decompose_mode` and architect output via `../../../core/decomposition-heuristics.md`. Write `decomposition.decision = "SINGLE_PASS"` explicitly. Never leave the stage at "pending". |
| Draft frames `test-engineer` as redundant ("fixer already wrote tests") | Tests written by fixer are unit-level for the diff; test-engineer runs the full suite and may find regressions in untouched modules. Dispatch. |
| Draft skips `acceptance_gate` because "single-pass with AC<3 — config says skip" | The AC<3 threshold is evaluated by `steps/07-acceptance-gate.md`, NOT in this controller. Read the step file, let it decide, and write `acceptance_gate.status = "skipped"` explicitly if the threshold is not met. Decomposition mode ALWAYS runs the gate. |
| Draft jumps to `publisher` after fixer-reviewer loop without reading `steps/06-test.md` | The dispatch table is the contract. Read each step file before dispatching. |
| Draft cites "pipeline is nearly done" as justification | Distance-to-completion is not a dispatch gate. The gate is the step file's config-evaluation logic. Dispatch or explicitly skip. |
| Draft inserts an inline `Task()` call without first writing `dispatched_at` + `dispatch_witness` | Pre-dispatch write is MANDATORY. If you cannot write the witness, you cannot dispatch. |
| Draft pretends "PostToolUse validator will catch it" as fallback | The hook is ADVISORY by default (exit 0). It emits audit lines but does NOT block. Subagent contracts and your own state.json writes are the enforcement. |

The ONLY pre-dispatch user interaction permitted is the existing pause/resume
prompt in `../../../core/resume-detection.md`. Any other question, summary, or options
menu BEFORE the first Task dispatch is a guard violation.
